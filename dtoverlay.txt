I keep running into Raspberry Pi articles which refer to various dtoverlay values in config.txt.  Some of these are documented in the default config file (i2c and spi, for example); others have been kind of a mystery to me.  A quick google turned up a couple of pages on the official raspberry pi github page:

https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/overlays/README

"dtoverlay" refers to device trees:  more info here:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md

There are a *ton* of overlays available, including for all kinds of miscellaneous i2c and SPI devices.  Physical hardware and displays too!

i2c stuff:

Lots of i2c sensors and miscellaneous hardware

i2c-gpio: software i2c controller on GPIO pins
i2c-mux: support i2c multiplexers (pca9542, etc)
i2c-rtc: rtc device support (see also i2c-rtc-gpio)
i2c-pwm-pca9685a: support PWM controller
mcp23017: GPIO expander


GPIO related stuff:

gpio-fan: configure GPIO pin to control a cooling fan
gpio-ir: infrared remote control
gpio-key: activate keypresses using gpio
gpio-poweroff: drive pin high or low at power off (note: interferes with gpio-shotdown)
gpio-shutdown: shut down system when gpio pin changes, power up again by driving gpio3 low
pps-gpio: pulse per second output on GPIO pin

Other goodies:

hd44780-lcd: drive text lcd
lirc-rpi: infrared remote control for pi
rotary-encoder: GPIO rotary encoder support.  Can wake device!
